# GRACE-FO-OpenToolkit
Code and Scripts for the GRACE mission
An open repository of community-contributed codes for processing GRACE-FO data. Official project algorithms are not included.

The current code in the example directory computes river basin mean using any shape file as a mask. The directory also contains a python user defined functions library that is used in the backend.  
The src dir contains a ready to use python script that generates monthly geotiff from a mascon netcdf file.
